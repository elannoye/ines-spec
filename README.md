# ines-spec
Interoperable energy system data specification. The spec is currently hosted by the Spine Toolbox DB file ines-spec.sqlite. Requires Spine Toolbox: https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox. The spec has also been exported to json, toml and yaml for faster access (if you don't have Spine Toolbox installed), but they are much harder to read.

The specification comes with an incomplete example dataset. When using the specification for other purposes, take a copy of the database and purge the database from data (but not of structure), see https://spine-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spine_db_editor/removing_data.html#purging-items.
