# ines-spec
Interoperable energy system data specification. The spec is currently hosted by the Spine Toolbox DB file ines-spec.sqlite. Requires Spine Toolbox v0.8 (not yet in the master branch): https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox/tree/0.8-dev. The spec has also been exported to json and yaml for faster access (if you don't have Toolbox v0.8 installed).
