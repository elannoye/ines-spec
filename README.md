# ines-spec
Interoperable energy system data specification. The spec is currently hosted by the Spine Toolbox DB file ines-spec.sqlite. Requires Spine Toolbox: https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox. The spec has also been exported to json, toml and yaml for faster access (if you don't have Spine Toolbox installed), but they are much harder to read.
