# INES Specification (ines-spec)

The INES (Interoperable Energy System) Specification defines a standardized data format for exchanging energy system models. This specification aims to facilitate interoperability between different energy modeling tools and platforms.

## Overview

The INES Specification is designed to support the seamless exchange of energy system data. It is currently hosted by the Spine Toolbox database file `ines-spec.sqlite` and requires Spine Toolbox v0.8 or later. The specification is also available in JSON and YAML formats for faster access.

## Features

- **Interoperability**: Enables the exchange of data between various energy modeling tools.
- **Flexibility**: Supports complex parameter structures and alternative parameter values to facilitate scenario building.
- **Compatibility**: Compatible with Spine Toolbox v0.8 and later versions.

## Installation

To use the INES Specification, you need to have Spine Toolbox v0.8 or later installed. You can download Spine Toolbox from the official Spine Toolbox repository.

## Usage

1. **Importing Data**: Use the Spine Toolbox to import data into the `ines-spec.sqlite` database.
2. **Exporting Data**: Export data from the `ines-spec.sqlite` database to JSON or YAML formats for use with other tools.
3. **Data Conversion**: Convert data between different modeling tools using the INES Specification.
