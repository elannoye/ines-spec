# ines-spec
Interoperable energy system data specification. The spec is currently hosted by the Spine Toolbox DB file ines-spec.sqlite. Required Spine Toolbox v0.8 (not yet in master): https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox/tree/0.8-dev. The spec has also been exported to the json file in the repo and the accompanying converter can be used to turn it into yaml for bit easier reading (need json and yaml packages in your environment).
